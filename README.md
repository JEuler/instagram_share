Many thanks to [zhouteng0217](https://github.com/zhouteng0217/ShareExtend) for specific lines
of code and for inspiration. Use the ShareExtend for generic share.

You can check the updated (forked) plugin with needed updates for Android

It will allow you to share media to iOS as well.

## Getting Started

Just use the `InstagramShare.share("path", mediaType: "video" or "image");`
